AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code as a ZIP file or container image, and Lambda automatically and precisely allocates compute execution power and runs your code based on the incoming request or event, for any scale of traffic. 

Available Languages: 
* Java
* Go
* PowerShell
* Node.js
* C#
* Python
* Ruby code

For the purposes of this repository, we will be focusing on using Python with AWS Lambda in order to facilitate data pre-processing and machine learning modeling.
